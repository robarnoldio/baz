# well alrighty then

I may just about have it.

What I missed was that I didn't really need to *only* upload my generated site
to github pages after I built it locally with Jekyll. All the magic crap that
happens when I run `jekyll build` client side is happening behind the scenes
server side on github pages.

So I need to work less hard than I was trying to in the first place. Just
update client side then `git push`.

*Added:* I need to add the new files to the repo first.

Next step: learn how to do all that from Atom directly.
